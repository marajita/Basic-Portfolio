            <p> Hi, I'm Rajita! I am learning web development simply because I loved it. I loved the thrill. I love to see my imagination come to life.</p>
            <p> I choose to be a web developer to bring my ideas to life and help others see what I think a better world looks like.</p>
            <p> World wide web is everywhere and everyone is on World wide web. If www didn't existed, We won't be able to google the question that we have and we didn't had an opportunity to express the opinion of the question and as a web developer you have the ability to involve in this movement and be the frontier of the revolution.</p>
